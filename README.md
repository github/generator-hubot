A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for creating your own chatbot using the Hubot framework


## Installation

- `npm install -g generator-hubot`

## Usage

- `yo hubot`

## Getting Started

See [Hubot's Getting Started
guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/index.md) for
details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.
`generator-hubot` is a replacement for `hubot --create`,
so you skip that step if you've done `yo hubot` already.
